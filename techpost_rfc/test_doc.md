# OWASP Top 10 - 2021 (Dummy for Testing)

## A01:2021-Broken Access Control
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.

## A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
The focus is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.

## A03:2021-Injection
Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

## A04:2021-Insecure Design
A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design flaws. If we want to "move left" as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures.

## A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
